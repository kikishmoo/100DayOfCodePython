# Day 3 Exercise

# Instructions
# You are going to write a program that tests the compatibility between two people.

# To work out the love score between two people:
# Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs. 
# Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs. 
# Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.

# For Love Scores less than 10 or greater than 90, the message should be:
# "Your score is **x**, you go together like coke and mentos."
# For Love Scores between 40 and 50, the message should be:
# "Your score is **y**, you are alright together."
# Otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g.:
# "Your score is **z**."


# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
print("Welcome to the Love Calculator!")
name1 = input("What is your name? \n")
name2 = input("What is their name? \n")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

t = name1.lower().count("t") + name2.lower().count("t") 
r = name1.lower().count("r") + name2.lower().count("r") 
u = name1.lower().count("u") + name2.lower().count("u") 
e = name1.lower().count("e") + name2.lower().count("e") 

l = name1.lower().count("l") + name2.lower().count("l") 
o = name1.lower().count("o") + name2.lower().count("o") 
v = name1.lower().count("v") + name2.lower().count("v") 

score = (t+r+u+e)*10+(l+o+v+e)

if score < 10 or score > 90:
    print(f"Your score is {score}, you go together like coke and mentos.")
# elif score >= 40 and score <= 50:
elif 40 <= score <= 50:
    print(f"Your score is {score}, you are alright together.") 
else: 
    print(f"Your score is {score}.") 



# e.g.
# name1 = "Angela Yu"
# name2 = "Jack Bauer"

  # T occurs 0 times
# R occurs 1 time
# U occurs 2 times
# E occurs 2 times
# Total = 5

# L occurs 1 time
# O occurs 0 times
# V occurs 0 times
# E occurs 2 times
# Total = 3

# Love Score = 53
# Print: "Your score is 53."

# Example Input 1
# name1 = "Kanye West"
# name2 = "Kim Kardashian"
# Example Output 1
# Your score is 42, you are alright together.
# Example Input 2
# name1 = "Brad Pitt"
# name2 = "Jennifer Aniston"
# Example Output 2
# Your score is 73.
# e.g. When you hit run, this is what should happen:

# The testing code will check for print output that is formatted like one of the lines below:
# "Your score is 47, you are alright together."
# "Your score is 125, you go together like coke and mentos."
# "Your score is 54."

# Score Comparison
# Not sure you're getting the correct score for the exercise? Use this table to check your code's score against mine.
# Name 1	Name 2	Score
# Catherine Zeta-Jones     	Michael Douglas    	99
# Brad Pitt	Jennifer Aniston	73
# Prince William	Kate Middleton	67
# Angela Yu	Jack Bauer	53
# Kanye West	Kim Kardashian	42
# Beyonce	Jay-Z	23
# John Lennon	Yoko Ono	18
